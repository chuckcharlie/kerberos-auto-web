[![Kerberos.io - video surveillance](https://kerberos.io/images/kerberos.png)](https://kerberos.io)

## Why Kerberos.io?

As burgalary is very common, we believe that video surveillance is a **trivial tool** in our daily lifes which helps us to **feel** a little bit more **secure**. Responding to this need, a lot of companies have started developing their own video surveillance software in the past few years.

Nowadays we have a myriad of **expensive** cameras, recorders and software solutions which are mainly **outdated** and **difficult** to install and use. Kerberos.io's goal is to solve these problems and to provide every human being in this world to have its own **ecological**, **affordable**, **easy-to-use** and **innovative** surveillance solution.

# Docker

**!!! For the moment this approach only works for IP cameras, we don't have a cross-platform method to inject a USB camera or Raspberry Pi camera !!!**

A Docker image (x86, ARMv7, ARMv8) is available on [**the Docker Hub**](https://hub.docker.com/u/kerberos/kerberos), which contains all the necessary software to setup your security infrastructure in a matter of seconds. Before you can run this image you will have to get [**Docker**](https://docker.com) installed. After the installation you can use **docker run** to get Kerberos.io up and running, or you can opt for **dockeros** to create and scale your security infrastructure.

## Use docker run

After you've installed docker, you can open a command prompt and type in following command. This will pull the kerberos image and make the web interface available on port 80 and the livestream on port 8889. You can give the container a custom name using the **--name** property.

To auto-configure the web setup, add the USERNAME and PASSWORD environment variables. These are not required.

    $ docker run --name camera1 -p 80:80 -p 8889:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos -e USERNAME='exampleuser' -e PASSWORD='examplepass'
    $ docker run --name camera2 -p 81:80 -p 8890:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos -e USERNAME='exampleuser' -e PASSWORD='examplepass'
    $ docker run --name camera3 -p 82:80 -p 8891:8889 -d kerberos/kerberos -e USERNAME='exampleuser' -e PASSWORD='examplepass'

## Or use dockeros (our docker creation tool)

We've created a simple and small tool to auto provision and auto configure Kerberos.io containers. The idea is that you define the different configurations for every camera upfront (/environments directory), and map them to into your Docker container (using volumes). The ultimate goal is to have a fully automated and lightning fast way for provisioning your video surveillance environments in just a matter of seconds. It's also a great way to backup your security configuration.

    CAMERA 1 <<== CONTAINER1 <<== environment/cameraconfig1
    CAMERA 2 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig2
    CAMERA 3 <<== CONTAINER2 <<== environment/cameraconfig3

### How to use it?

The tool we've created is a simple bash script which we called **dockeros**, and exposes a couple of methods; discussed below. By specifying a number of parameters, **dockeros** will do all the magic dockering for you. This tool is still work in progress, so PR's and new features are welcome!

    git clone https://github.com/kerberos-io/docker
    cd docker/bin
    ./dockeros.sh {command}

### Commands

List all kerberos.io containers which are created.

    ./dockeros.sh showall


Remove all kerberos.io containers which were created before.

    ./dockeros.sh cleanup

Create a kerberos.io container with a name and predefined configuration.

    ./dockeros.sh create {name} {config} {webport} {streamport}

* **name**: This is the name of the container which will be created.

* **config**: The configuration which needs to be injected in the container. The configuration directories can be found in the **/environments** folder.

* **webport**: The port on which the webinterface will be served.

* **streamport**: The port on which the livestream will be served.
